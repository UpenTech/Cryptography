# Vigenère cipher

    We're all familiar with Ceaser's cipher i.e. the words are enrypted by shifting the alplhabets by a constant position. One key issue with with this algorithm is that it's highly vulnerable to frequency analysis. This signified the need for a strong cipher algorithmn in order to move ahead than cryptoanalysts. This led to procurement of a cipher algorighmn known as Vigenère cipher. 

    This algrithmn implements the Ceaser's cipher to each letters based on a agreeed upon cipher key. Using this algorithm, a same letter can appear in many form - making it strong against frequency analysis.
